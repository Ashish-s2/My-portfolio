      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I'm a final-year Biomedical Engineering student at NIT Rourkela, with a strong interest in software development and technology. I love learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-life challenges, especially at the intersection of healthcare and computing.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        My experience includes working with web development (React, Node.js), data structures and algorithms, and collaborating in team-based projects. I'm open to SDE roles and keen to grow as a developer.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech, reading, or playing chess.
